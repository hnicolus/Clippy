# Clippy


This project started from a MEME literally. I was just frustrated and I missed the clipboard history windows has. SO I decided to spend a few minutes to 
recreate a cross-platform version of it. 

## Tech 

  - Honestly this was never planned Avalonia just popped up and I said why not?
 
 ## Features ?
  - At the moment this just stores your cliboard history in memory 
  - Clears the Item if you click it twice - (this wwas a bug at first and then became a feature I think I can improve)
  - It does not have the pinning capabilities The Windows Clipboard has but that can be easily implemented :I just add it to my todo list
  - Currently dont like some of the coding decisions I took in the little program I just didn't want to spend alot of time on creating a POC.
